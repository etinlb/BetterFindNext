# BetterFindNext

A find next plugin that (attempts to) understand code.

BetterFindNext is aims to be a smarter version of the built in find_next (super+d) command. It achieves this by allowing the user to customize what scope gets ignored. 


## Default Key bindings and Behavior 

By default, the shortcut maps to `ctrl+w` and ignores adding strings or comments. 

## Ignore Options
The key binding accepts a list of scopes as it's `excluded_scopes` args.  

## TODO
Requests can be submitted in the issue. Current plans are
- Limit find to current function 
- Limit find to current indentation 
- Allow included_scopes option
